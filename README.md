hubot-schedule is a message scheduler runs on hubot.

It allows you to schedule a message in both `cron-style` and `datetime-based` format pattern.
It is for time-based scheduling, not interval-based scheduling.

Since hubot-schedule uses node-schedule to manage schedule, some of the cron features are not supported.
Please see [node-schedule](https://github.com/mattpat/node-schedule) for more details.

This script is greatly inspired by [hubot-cron](https://github.com/miyagawa/hubot-cron).
At first, I wanted a datetime-based scheduler.
As I start developing this, I noticed that node-schedule also suppports cron-style scheduling, so I changed my mind to develop a scheduler that supports both cron-style and datetime-based format.

(Hubot posts the message at 2015-01-16 10:00:00 and schedule will be removed automatically)

Hubot> hubot schedule del 9735
9735: Schedule canceled

Hubot> hubot schedule list
Message is not scheduled

Hubot> hubot schedule add "0 10 * * 1-5" hubot image me coffee
9735: Schedule created
(hubot can process messages sent by hubot-schedule, so you can ask hubot to do something at the scheduled time, like post an image of coffee.)
```

If you need to persist scheduled messages, use hubot-brain persistent module like [hubot-redis-brain](https://github.com/hubot-scripts/hubot-redis-brain).
